    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Okro soup is a signature food that defines the African culinary heritage. 
        It is prepared using a variation of ingredients from traditional recipes 
        passed down from generations to generations across West African countries 
        and some Central African countries. It is one of the foods that African mothers 
        introduce to infants as they transition from liquid to semi-solid foods. 
        As they grow to become adults, the flavor of Okro Soup is embedded into the depth 
        of their taste buds.</p>
