    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Palm nut soup is made using palm fruit extract or palm fruit concentrate. 
        Palm nut (also known as palm kernel) is the fruit of the oil palm tree native 
        to West and Central Africa and some Asian countries. 
        It lends a delightfully nutty and ethnic flavor to this soup!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Palm-nut concentrate</li>
        <li>Meat or fish of choice</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the palm nut concentrate into a pot. 
            Add the fresh shrimp and spices and let it boil for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Add your catfish and simmer for about 15 minutes</li>
        <li>When the Banga soup is almost ready, the oil from the palm kernel
             will begin to rise to the surface and give off a lovely aroma.</li>
    </ol>
